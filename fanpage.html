<h2>About</h2>
<p> BTS is a seven member Korean group that debuted back in 2013 under a small music company. Over the years they've continued to rise in popuarity partly due the the huge amount of online content they show to their fans. They work tirelessly on their music bringing moving lyrics, complex coreography, and insane performances. At the beginning and even now they were talked down upon and told they were doomed to fail along with their company. Today they're continuing to win countless awards, break records, perform all around the world, and even spoke at the United Nations twice due to their impact. However the drawing thing about BTS is despite all the fame and money they recieve they continue to remain humble, not letting any of it get to their heads. </p>
<h2> The Members </h2>

  <p>As mentioned previously, this group has seven members that consists of 3 rappers and 4 vocalists. Here is a brief description of each member in age order:</p>
  <h3>˗ˏˋJin (Kim Seokjin)ˎˊ˗</h3>
     <image src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/537e9d4923e6b5d5bfac9aebd9437d80/tumblr_inline_pa0ud6IBZU1rggvge_540.gif">
<p>Jin is the oldest member of the group and is 1/4 of the vocalists. He was born December 4th, 1992. Some random facts about him is that he loves to cook, play video games, and says a lot of dad jokes. A solo song of his I'd recommed is "Moon" off of their most recent album. </p>
    <h3>˗ˏˋSuga (Min Yoongi)ˎˊ˗</h3>
       <image src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/573935fd54028aa81c12651ca137f25d/tumblr_peubm08hu11w15kmho1_400.gifv">
    <p>Yoongi was born March 9th, 1993 and is 1/3 of the rap line in BTS. He is also one of hte members that contributes greatly when it comes to writing and producing their music. He loves sleep, basketball, and when he isn't writing music for the group he's working on his solo works. He currently has two mixtapes out under the name Agust D. From the group I recommend his song "Trivia: Seesaw" and from his mixtape I reccomend his latest song "Daechwita."</p>
    <h3>˗ˏˋJ-Hope (Jung Hoseok)ˎˊ˗ </h3>
       <image src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9e/76/f1/9e76f19d4c09ee9c2e61596a2995dfda.gif">
    <p>J-hope is a rapper under the group. He was born February 18th, 1994 is greatly praised for his dancing and is known for it. A lot of the fans also refer to him as sunshine due to his bright personality and charisma that lights up the room. He also has a mixtape called Hope World and a song I reccomed from it is "Daydream". From his songs in the group, I'd give "Trivia: Just Dance" a listen!</p>
    <h3> ˗ˏˋ RM (Kim Namjoon)ˎˊ˗ </h3>
      <image src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3b/ac/f7/3bacf7bfd7cf8dfa547739aecd50668f.gif">
    <p>Namjoon is the last of the 3 rappers and is also the leader of the group. He was born September 12,1994. He also writes a lot of the lyrics for the groups songs and it praised for his word play and references in the lyrics. Like the other 2 rappers he also has a mixtape, two in fact. His most recent on was titled Mono consistenting of popular tracks like "Forever Rain" and "Seoul". As for his solo songs in Bts, "Trivia: Love" is the one I'd recommend.</p>
   <h3> ˗ˏˋJimin (Park Jimin)ˎˊ˗ </h3>
      <image src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/288642273/original.gif">
    <p>Jimin was born October 13, 1995 was is 1/4 of the vocalists in Bts. Like J-Hope, Jimin is praised for his dancing skills. When he was younger he trained in contemporary dance and even earned a full scholarship to study it as he was very skilled but lacking in the money to pay for it. From the songs he's sung himself, I would recommend "Serendipity". Due to the fact that I can't help myself, I've embedded a video of a short contemporary dance he did last year at an award show to an instrumental version of their song "I Need You".</p>

     <h3>˗ˏˋV (Kim Taehyung)ˎˊ˗</h3>

        <p>Taehyung was born Decenber 31, 1995 and is another vocalist in Bts. He is known for his deeper singing voice. Besides being a singer he also enjoys art and even has an acting credit in the korean drama "Hwarang". The songs I'd recommend that he's sung is "Singularity". </p>
     <h3>˗ˏˋJungkook (Jeon Jeongguk)ˎˊ˗</h3>
          <image src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/c99a847b46a06e327a27cf7b6e477c04/tumblr_p5s3ne4Apo1w8ve6ho2_400.gif">
        <p>The final and youngest member is Jungkook and he was born on September 1, 1997. He is seen as the ace of the group because he's pretty much good at anything. Singing, dancing, painting, literally any game you name it and he comes out on top. Over that past couple years he's been releasing short  cinematic vlog type videos that are just beautifully done. Just search up Golden Closet Films on youtube, trust me you will not be disappointed! I also highly recommend you listen to "Euphoria" and/or "Still With You"!</p>
<h2> Their Music </h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLmpbhDC2rNg_sL4oaZiquBvK5fLY7VSkC" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>
    <p>Having been around for seven years, they've racked up quite a diverse discography. Many see them as just a pop group but Bts has experimented with many genres such as hip-hop, rap-rock, edm, punk, ballads, latin-pop, funk-rap, R&B, etc. Also, many assume every song includes all the members but they also release solo and unit songs in their albums. They are also very involved in creating their music as many of them members compose the music and write lyrics. The thing that makes them really stand out though are the lyrics and messages they make with their songs. BTS since debut has talked about issues and topics in their music that wasn't really being addressed in pop culture. They've tackled things like mental health, bullying, stress, politics, societal expecations and so much <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2018/03/16/12-bts-songs-strong-social-messages">more</a>. Recently their main message as been to love yourself and they've even launched campaigns about it. To further highlight the diversity in their music I've embeded a tweet below that shows snippets of the songs on their past album Map of the Soul: 7. </p>
